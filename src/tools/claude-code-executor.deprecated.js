/**
 * DEPRECATED - INCORRECT IMPLEMENTATION
 * 
 * This file contains an incorrect implementation based on wrong assumptions
 * about how Claude Code works.
 * 
 * ACTUAL CLAUDE CODE:
 * - Is installed via: npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
 * - Uses command: claude (not claude-code)
 * - Is an INTERACTIVE terminal tool, not a headless CLI
 * - Does NOT support automation with flags like -p, --model, etc.
 * - Does NOT have environment variables like CLAUDE_CODE_HEADLESS
 * 
 * Claude Code is designed for interactive use in the terminal where
 * developers can have a conversation with Claude about their code.
 * It cannot be automated or run in headless mode as this implementation
 * attempted to do.
 * 
 * For programmatic access to Claude, use the Anthropic API directly:
 * https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/getting-started
 * 
 * This file is kept for reference but should not be used.
