Current State:
✅ Test infrastructure is fully implemented
✅ Test harness with mocks is ready
✅ Sample tests are passing
❌ MCP tool implementations are pending

Available Tests:
• npm test         - Run sample tests (working)
• npm run test:harness - Verify test framework (working)
• npm run test:benchmark - Run performance benchmarks (working)

Pending Implementation:
The following test commands will work once MCP tools are implemented:
• npm run test:unit
• npm run test:integration  
• npm run test:all

Next Steps:
1. Implement MCP tools in src/tools/
2. Update package.json test scripts to run full suite
3. Run full test coverage

For now, the test harness demonstrates how tests will work once
the tools are implemented. The sample tests verify that the
Node.js test runner is configured correctly.
