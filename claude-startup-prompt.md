# Claude Desktop Startup Prompt for Obsidian Vault

Copy and paste this at the beginning of your Claude Desktop session:

---

I'm working with my Obsidian vault using the Obsidian AI Curator MCP server. 

Please ensure you:
1. Read and follow all instructions in `/Users/nathan/projects/obsidian-ai-curator/LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
2. Use the MCP server tools for ALL vault operations (never direct file writes)
3. Follow these critical formatting rules:
   - Dates: yyyy-MM-dd format only
   - Tags: no hashtags in frontmatter
   - Frontmatter: simple structures only (no arrays of objects)
   - Links: [[wikilink]] format only

The project instructions are in `/Users/nathan/projects/obsidian-ai-curator/CLAUDE.md` and `/Users/nathan/projects/obsidian-ai-curator/LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

Then continue with your specific request.
