# Fix PerformanceMonitor Stub Implementations

You are working on the Obsidian AI Curator project. Your task is to implement the methods marked with @stub in src/metrics/performance-monitor.js.

## Current State
The file has basic implementations that need enhancement to pass all tests. The methods marked with @stub are:
- startOperation() / endOperation() - Needs distributed tracing
- setThresholds() / checkThreshold() - Needs alerting, auto-scaling
- calculatePercentiles() - Needs sliding window, outlier detection
- getMemoryUsage() - Needs trend analysis, leak detection
- getSuccessRate() - Needs categorization, root cause analysis

## Requirements
1. Read the test file at test/unit/performance-monitor.test.js to understand expected behavior
2. Implement each @stub method to make ALL tests pass
3. Ensure performance tracking is accurate and efficient
4. Add proper memory management and cleanup
5. Support concurrent operation tracking

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use Map or WeakMap for operation tracking to prevent memory leaks
- Implement sliding window algorithm for percentile calculations
- Add proper error categorization for success rate analysis
- Ensure thread-safe operation for concurrent tracking
- Keep overhead minimal (this is performance monitoring after all!)

## Testing
After implementing each method:
1. Run: NODE_ENV=test NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules npx jest test/unit/performance-monitor.test.js --config jest.simple.config.js
2. Fix any failing tests
3. Verify performance overhead is minimal

## Success Criteria
- All tests in performance-monitor.test.js pass
- Memory usage remains stable over time
- Accurate percentile calculations
- Proper threshold alerting
- Clean, well-documented code

Start by reading the test file to understand the expected behavior, then implement each method systematically.
