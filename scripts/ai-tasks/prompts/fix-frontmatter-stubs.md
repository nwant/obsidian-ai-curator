# Fix FrontmatterManager Stub Implementations

You are working on the Obsidian AI Curator project. Your task is to implement the methods marked with @stub in src/tools/frontmatter-manager.js.

## Current State
The file has basic implementations that need enhancement to pass all tests. The methods marked with @stub are:
- extractFrontmatter() - Needs advanced parsing, error recovery
- validateFrontmatter() - Needs custom validation rules, type checking  
- formatFrontmatter() - Needs template support, field transformations

## Requirements
1. Read the test file at test/unit/frontmatter-manager.test.js to understand expected behavior
2. Implement each @stub method to make ALL tests pass
3. Handle edge cases gracefully (malformed YAML, missing fields, etc.)
4. Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
5. Add appropriate error handling and recovery

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use the existing gray-matter library for YAML parsing
- For malformed YAML, implement graceful degradation (extract what you can)
- For validation, support both built-in and custom validators
- For formatting, ensure proper YAML output that Obsidian can read

## Testing
After implementing each method:
1. Run: NODE_ENV=test NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules npx jest test/unit/frontmatter-manager.test.js --config jest.simple.config.js
2. Fix any failing tests
3. Ensure no regression in existing functionality

## Success Criteria
- All tests in frontmatter-manager.test.js pass
- No breaking changes to existing API
- Proper error handling for edge cases
- Clean, well-commented code

Start by reading the test file to understand the expected behavior, then implement each method one by one.
