- Comprehensive analytics

## Phase 6: Testing & Release (Week 11-12)
**Goal**: Production-ready plugin

### 6.1 Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Integration tests with MCP server
- [ ] Performance testing with large vaults
- [ ] User acceptance testing

### 6.2 Documentation
- [ ] Write user documentation
- [ ] Create video tutorials
- [ ] Document API for developers
- [ ] Build example workflows

### 6.3 Release Preparation
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Create plugin manifest
- [ ] Submit to Obsidian community plugins

### Deliverables
- Tested, documented plugin
- Release package
- User documentation

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: Obsidian Plugin API
- **Communication**: WebSocket
- **State Management**: MobX or Zustand
- **UI Components**: Custom + Obsidian components
- **Build Tool**: esbuild

### Key Classes
```typescript
class AICuratorPlugin extends Plugin {
  settings: AICuratorSettings;
  mpcClient: MPCClient;
  contextManager: ContextManager;
  consolidationView: ConsolidationView;
  linkManager: LinkManager;
}

class MPCClient {
  connect(): Promise<void>;
  send(message: Message): Promise<Response>;
  on(event: string, handler: Function): void;
}

class ContextManager {
  saveContext(conversation: Conversation): Promise<void>;
  loadContext(threadId: string): Promise<Context>;
  detectRelevantContext(): Promise<Context[]>;
}
```

### Data Flow
```
Obsidian Events → Plugin → WebSocket → MCP Server → Claude
                    ↑                      ↓
                    ← UI Updates ← Results ←
```

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1-2
- Successfully connects to MCP server
- File changes sync in <100ms
- Metadata extraction covers 95% of vault

### Phase 3-4
- Users approve 70%+ of consolidation suggestions
- Context loads correctly 95% of time
- Visual feedback rated "satisfying" by testers

### Phase 5-6
- Performance: <50ms response time for operations
- Stability: <0.1% crash rate
- Adoption: 100+ downloads in first month

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **WebSocket instability**: Implement robust reconnection
- **Performance impact**: Use efficient caching and debouncing
- **API changes**: Abstract Obsidian API usage

### User Experience Risks
- **Too intrusive**: Add quiet mode and customization
- **Learning curve**: Progressive disclosure of features
- **Trust issues**: Clear operation previews and undo

## Future Enhancements

### Version 2.0
- Multi-vault synchronization
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced visualization (knowledge graphs)
- Mobile app support

### Version 3.0
- Third-party AI model support
- Plugin ecosystem (extensions)
- Enterprise features
- Advanced analytics

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 1 Senior Developer (full-time)
- 1 UI/UX Designer (part-time)
- 1 QA Tester (part-time)

### Timeline
- 12 weeks to v1.0
- 2 weeks buffer for issues
- 2 weeks for community feedback and iteration

### Infrastructure
- Development environment
- Test vaults with various sizes
- Beta testing group (10-20 users)
- Documentation hosting

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured path from basic integration to a full-featured Obsidian plugin. The phased approach allows for iterative development, user feedback, and risk mitigation while building toward the vision of an AI-powered knowledge consolidation system that feels like "Tetris for knowledge."
