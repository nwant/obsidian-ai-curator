# Phase 2 Complete: Enhanced Intelligence ✅

## Overview
Phase 2 is now complete! The Obsidian plugin has full intelligence capabilities, providing rich metadata, context awareness, and link validation with the MCP server.

## Completed Features

### 1. **Rich Metadata Extraction** ✅
The plugin extracts and sends:
- Frontmatter fields
- Links with positions
- Tags
- Headings with levels
- Backlinks

### 2. **Context Awareness** ✅
Real-time tracking of:
- **Active File**: Currently open file
- **Recent Files**: Last 20 files opened
- **Open Files**: All tabs
- **Recently Modified**: Top 10 by mtime
- **Current Folder**: Working directory
- **Workspace Layout**: Single/split/tabs

### 3. **Link Intelligence** ✅
Advanced link management:
- **Link Validation**: Check for broken links in current file
- **Suggestions**: Fuzzy matching for broken links
- **Move Preview**: See what links will update before moving files
- **File Interceptor**: Automatically preview impacts when renaming

## New Commands

1. **"Validate links in current file"**
   - Scans current file for broken links
   - Shows suggestions based on fuzzy matching
   - Modal interface for reviewing results

2. **"Show current workspace context"**
   - Displays active file and recent files
   - Useful for debugging context tracking

## How Link Intelligence Works

### Link Validation
```typescript
// The plugin:
1. Scans file for all [[wiki links]] and [markdown](links.md)
2. Checks if target files exist
3. Suggests similar files for broken links
4. Shows results in a modal
```

### Move Preview
```typescript
// When renaming a file:
1. Intercepts the rename operation
2. Queries server for affected files
3. Shows preview of all link updates
4. User can cancel or proceed
```

### Server Integration
- WebSocket server maintains link index
- Tracks forward and backward links
- Calculates link updates for moves
- Provides instant backlink information

## Testing the Features

### Test Link Validation
1. Create a note with some broken links:
   ```markdown
   This links to [[Non-Existent Note]] and [[Another Missing File]].
   ```
2. Run command: "Validate links in current file"
3. See broken links and suggestions

### Test Move Preview
1. Create two notes where one links to the other
2. Try to rename the linked note
3. See preview modal showing what will update
4. Choose to proceed or cancel

### Test Context Tracking
1. Open several files
2. Switch between them
3. Watch server console for context updates
4. Run "Show current workspace context" command

## Architecture Improvements

### Plugin Side
- **LinkValidator**: Handles validation and preview UI
- **FileInterceptor**: Hooks into Obsidian's rename operations
- **ContextTracker**: Monitors workspace state

### Server Side
- **Link Index**: Persistent forward/backward link tracking
- **Move Preview**: Calculates link update impacts
- **Context Storage**: Maintains workspace awareness

## What This Enables

With Phase 2 complete, the system now has:
1. **Full Awareness**: Knows what you're working on and how files relate
2. **Link Safety**: Prevents broken links during file operations
3. **Smart Suggestions**: Can suggest fixes for broken links
4. **Context for AI**: Rich information for intelligent operations

## Phase 2 Metrics

- **Components Added**: 3 (ContextTracker, LinkValidator, FileInterceptor)
- **Server Endpoints**: 1 new (preview-move)
- **Commands Added**: 2
- **UI Elements**: 2 modals (validation results, move preview)

## Ready for Phase 3

The intelligence foundation is complete. Phase 3 will build on this to create:
- Visual consolidation suggestions
- Knowledge density indicators
- The "Tetris for knowledge" experience

The plugin now has all the data it needs to make intelligent suggestions about note consolidation!
