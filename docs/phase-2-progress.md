# Phase 2 Progress: Enhanced Intelligence

## Completed Features

### 1. **Context Tracking** ✅
The plugin now tracks and sends real-time workspace context to the server:

- **Active File**: Currently open file
- **Recent Files**: Last 20 files opened (in order)
- **Open Files**: All files currently open in tabs
- **Recently Modified**: Top 10 files by modification time
- **Current Folder**: Active file's directory
- **Workspace Layout**: Single, multiple tabs, or split view

### 2. **Rich Metadata** ✅
Already implemented in Phase 1, the plugin sends:
- Frontmatter
- Links (with positions)
- Tags
- Headings
- Backlinks

### 3. **WebSocket Server Enhancement** ✅
The server now:
- Receives and logs workspace context
- Stores context for intelligent operations
- Can check backlinks for active files
- Ready for AI-powered suggestions

## How It Works

1. **Context Updates**: Sent on:
   - Active file change
   - File open/close
   - Layout changes
   - Debounced to avoid spam (500ms)

2. **Smart Tracking**:
   - Recent files list maintains order
   - Duplicates removed from open files
   - Context only sent when changed

3. **New Command**: "Show current workspace context"
   - Displays active file and recent files
   - Useful for debugging

## Testing the Context Tracker

1. **Start the WebSocket server**:
   ```bash
   npm run start:ws
   ```

2. **Reload the plugin** in Obsidian

3. **Watch the server console** as you:
   - Switch between files
   - Open new files
   - Change layout
   - The server will log context updates

4. **Use the command** "Show current workspace context" to see what's being tracked

## Next Steps for Phase 2

### Link Intelligence Integration (Remaining)
- [ ] Show link validation warnings in Obsidian
- [ ] Preview link updates before file moves
- [ ] Integrate with server's link index for suggestions

## What This Enables

With context tracking, the server now knows:
- What you're working on
- Your navigation patterns
- Related files you might need
- Your working style (tabs vs splits)

This context will be crucial for:
- Smart consolidation suggestions
- Relevant file recommendations
- Context-aware AI assistance
- Pattern detection for workflows
