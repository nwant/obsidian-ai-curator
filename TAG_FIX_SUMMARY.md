# Tag Fix Summary

## What We Did

1. **Created comprehensive LLM instructions** to prevent the issue:
   - `LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Detailed guide with examples
   - `claude-project-instructions.md` - Quick reference for Claude
   - Updated `CLAUDE.md` - Project-specific instructions
   - Updated `README.md` - Added critical warning section
   - Updated `docs/tag-usage-guidelines.md` - Added format warning

2. **Attempted code fixes** (partially successful):
   - Added regex cleaning at the start of `writeNote` to remove hashtags
   - Updated tag processing components to work without hashtags
   - Added final cleanup step before writing

## The Core Issue

The MCP server's tag intelligence system expects hashtags throughout its processing pipeline. When we remove hashtags at the beginning, they get re-added during processing, causing the original tags with hashtags to become `null` values.

## The Solution

**Instruct the LLM to never use hashtags in frontmatter tags.**

This is the most reliable fix because:
- It prevents the issue at the source
- It follows Obsidian's native conventions
- It avoids fighting against the MCP server's design

## For Users

1. **Update your Claude instructions** with the provided guidelines
2. **For existing notes with hashtags**: They need to be manually fixed (remove hashtags)
3. **Going forward**: Ensure all LLMs/tools follow the no-hashtag convention for frontmatter

## Technical Details

- YAML treats `#` as a comment marker
- Unquoted `#tag` becomes `null` when parsed
- The MCP server adds hashtags back during processing
- A complete fix would require refactoring the entire tag system
